```
Scenario 1: Compare the same instance of Cart

Details:
  TestName: compareSameInstance
  Description: Verify that the equals method returns true when comparing the same instance of the Cart object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Cart object.
  Act: Call the equals method with the same Cart instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies when it is comparing the same object instance. This is significant because it ensures the method handles object identity correctly.

Scenario 2: Compare Cart instance with null

Details:
  TestName: compareWithNull
  Description: Verify that the equals method returns false when comparing a Cart object with null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Cart object.
  Act: Call the equals method with null.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies when it is comparing an object to null. This is significant for ensuring the method handles null values gracefully.

Scenario 3: Compare Cart instance with a different class object

Details:
  TestName: compareWithDifferentClassObject
  Description: Verify that the equals method returns false when comparing a Cart object with an object of a different class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Cart object and an object of a different class (e.g., String).
  Act: Call the equals method with the different class object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies when it is comparing objects of different types. This is significant for ensuring type safety.

Scenario 4: Compare two Cart instances with identical attributes

Details:
  TestName: compareIdenticalCarts
  Description: Verify that the equals method returns true when comparing two Cart objects with identical attributes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Cart objects with identical books and purchased status.
  Act: Call the equals method with one Cart instance and pass the other as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies when two objects are logically equivalent. This is significant for ensuring the method correctly implements value-based equality.

Scenario 5: Compare two Cart instances with different books lists

Details:
  TestName: compareCartsWithDifferentBooks
  Description: Verify that the equals method returns false when comparing two Cart objects with different books lists.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Cart objects with different books lists but the same purchased status.
  Act: Call the equals method with one Cart instance and pass the other as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies differences in the books attribute. This is significant for ensuring the method's accuracy in comparing complex attributes.

Scenario 6: Compare two Cart instances with different purchased statuses

Details:
  TestName: compareCartsWithDifferentPurchasedStatus
  Description: Verify that the equals method returns false when comparing two Cart objects with different purchased statuses.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Cart objects with the same books list but different purchased statuses.
  Act: Call the equals method with one Cart instance and pass the other as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies differences in the purchased attribute. This is significant for ensuring the method's accuracy in comparing simple attributes.

Scenario 7: Compare two Cart instances where one has a null books list

Details:
  TestName: compareCartsWithNullBooks
  Description: Verify that the equals method returns false when comparing a Cart object with a null books list to another Cart object with a non-null books list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create one Cart object with a null books list and another Cart object with a non-null books list but the same purchased status.
  Act: Call the equals method with the Cart instance with a null books list and pass the other as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles null values in complex attributes. This is significant for ensuring robustness and correctness in edge cases.

Scenario 8: Compare two Cart instances where both have null books lists

Details:
  TestName: compareCartsWithBothNullBooks
  Description: Verify that the equals method returns true when comparing two Cart objects where both have null books lists but identical purchased statuses.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Cart objects where both have null books lists and identical purchased statuses.
  Act: Call the equals method with one Cart instance and pass the other as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles cases where both objects have null values for complex attributes. This is significant for ensuring consistency in equality checks.

Scenario 9: Compare Cart instance with another instance of the same Cart class but different attributes

Details:
  TestName: compareDifferentCarts
  Description: Verify that the equals method returns false when comparing two Cart objects with different attributes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Cart objects with different books lists and different purchased statuses.
  Act: Call the equals method with one Cart instance and pass the other as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies when two objects are not equivalent. This is significant for ensuring the method's discriminatory power in distinguishing between different instances.

Scenario 10: Compare Cart instance with another instance of Cart class having empty books list

Details:
  TestName: compareCartWithEmptyBooks
  Description: Verify that the equals method returns false when comparing a Cart object with a non-empty books list to another Cart object with an empty books list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create one Cart object with a non-empty books list and another Cart object with an empty books list but the same purchased status.
  Act: Call the equals method with the Cart instance with a non-empty books list and pass the other as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles cases where one object has an empty list while the other does not. This is significant for ensuring the method's robustness in handling varying list contents.
