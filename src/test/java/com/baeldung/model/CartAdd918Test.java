Scenario 1: Testing to add a book to the list

Details:
  TestName: testAddingBook
  Description: This test is designed to verify that a book can be added successfully to the list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Book instance and List of Books.
  Act: Invoke the add method on the list of books, passing the created Book instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit's assertEquals to check if the book added to the list is the book we created.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the book successfully added to the list of books is equivalent to the book we initially created. This test is relevant for ensuring the method's functionality to add books into the list, so book records are correctly kept and accessed when needed.

Scenario 2: Validate adding a null book

Details:
  TestName: testAddingNullBook
  Description: This test is designed to check the method's behavior when a null book is attempted to be added.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a Book instance as null.
  Act: Invoke the add method with the null Book instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit's expectThrows to verify whether Null Pointer Exception is thrown.
Validation:
  It's important to test this scenario to ensure that the application appropriately handles null inputs, so no unintended side effects occur later when NullPointerExceptions are not handled.

Scenario 3: Validate adding the same book instance multiple times

Details:
  TestName: testAddingDuplicateBooks
  Description: This test is aimed to verify the method's behavior when duplicate books (same instance) are added.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a Book instance.
  Act: Invoke the add method with the same book instance twice or more.
  Assert: Use JUnit's assertEquals to verify the list size.
Validation:
  This validation verifies if the list accepts and handles duplicates, and the expected result is based on whether or not the list of books should allow duplicates.

Scenario 4: Validate add operation when the list is already full

Details:
  TestName: testAddingBookWhenListFull
  Description: This test is to verify the method's behavior when the list of books is already full.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define the maximum number of book instances for the list and fill up the book list.
  Act: Invoke the add method with another new book instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit's expectThrows to verify whether an Out of Memory Exception is thrown or check the size of the list with the predefined maximum size.
Validation:
  This would help to understand how the method behaves when the list is already full, whether it throws an exception or silently rejects the add operation.
