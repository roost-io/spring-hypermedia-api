"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if getBooks retrieve the list successfully

TestName: testGetBooksSuccessfully
Description: This test will check if getBooks method retrieves all the books in the list correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: A list of books must be pre-populated.
  Act: Invoke the getBooks method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual list returned by the method vs the expected list of books.
Validation: 
  The goal here is to verify the functionality of the getBooks method to ensure it correctly retrieves all the books from the list. This is essential for display or reference purposes in the application.

Scenario 2: Test to check if getBooks return empty collection when no books are available

TestName: testGetBooksEmptyCollection
Description: This test will check if the getBooks method returns an empty list when there are no books.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure no books are added to the list.
  Act: Invoke the getBooks method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify the size of the returned list, which should be 0.
Validation: 
  The test will validate the critical scenario where the getBooks method is capable of handling situations without any books. This will ensure that the method behaves as expected in all scenarios.

Scenario 3: Test to check if getBooks return correct size

TestName: testGetBooksCorrectSize
Description: This test will ensure if the getBooks method returns a list with a size that matches the number of books added.
Execution:
  Arrange: A list of books added with a known quantity.
  Act: Invoke the getBooks method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the size of the returned list matches the number of books added.
Validation: 
  This validation is essential to verify the compatibility of the getBooks method with the listâ€™s actual size. A successful test here will establish the reliability of the method's ability to reflect the accurate number of books in any given list. 

Scenario 4: Test to check if getBooks return the same object references

TestName: testGetBooksSameReferences
Description: This test will check if the getBooks method returns the list with the same object references as those added.
Execution:
  Arrange: A list of books added with known object references.
  Act: Invoke the getBooks method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the returned list holds the same object references as those added.
Validation: 
  This validation checks the object integrity with respect to memory and reference, an invaluable one for the cases where the list returned by getBooks is manipulated, and the impact should reflect on the original list of books.
