```
Scenario 1: Hash code when books is null and purchased is false

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeBooksNullPurchasedFalse
  Description: This test checks the hash code calculation when the list of books is null and the purchased flag is false.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with books set to null and purchased set to false.
  Act: Call the hashCode method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify the hash code value.
Validation:
  Verify that the hash code is calculated correctly when books is null and purchased is false, ensuring that null handling is implemented correctly in the hash code method.

Scenario 2: Hash code when books is null and purchased is true

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeBooksNullPurchasedTrue
  Description: This test checks the hash code calculation when the list of books is null and the purchased flag is true.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with books set to null and purchased set to true.
  Act: Call the hashCode method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify the hash code value.
Validation:
  Verify that the hash code is calculated correctly when books is null and purchased is true, ensuring that null handling is implemented correctly in the hash code method.

Scenario 3: Hash code when books is empty and purchased is false

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeBooksEmptyPurchasedFalse
  Description: This test checks the hash code calculation when the list of books is empty and the purchased flag is false.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with books set to an empty list and purchased set to false.
  Act: Call the hashCode method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify the hash code value.
Validation:
  Verify that the hash code is calculated correctly when books is an empty list and purchased is false, ensuring that the hash code method handles empty lists properly.

Scenario 4: Hash code when books is empty and purchased is true

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeBooksEmptyPurchasedTrue
  Description: This test checks the hash code calculation when the list of books is empty and the purchased flag is true.
Execution:

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with books set to a list containing one book and purchased set to false.
  Act: Call the hashCode method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify the hash code value.
Validation:
  Verify that the hash code is calculated correctly when books has one element and purchased is false, ensuring that the hash code method calculates the hash code correctly for lists with one element.

Scenario 6: Hash code when books has one element and purchased is true

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeBooksOneElementPurchasedTrue
  Description: This test checks the hash code calculation when the list of books has one element and the purchased flag is true.

  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify the hash code value.
Validation:
  Verify that the hash code is calculated correctly when books has one element and purchased is true, ensuring that the hash code method calculates the hash code correctly for lists with one element.

Scenario 7: Hash code when books has multiple elements and purchased is false

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeBooksMultipleElementsPurchasedFalse
  Description: This test checks the hash code calculation when the list of books has multiple elements and the purchased flag is false.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with books set to a list containing multiple books and purchased set to false.
  Act: Call the hashCode method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify the hash code value.
Validation:
  Verify that the hash code is calculated correctly when books has multiple elements and purchased is false, ensuring that the hash code method handles lists with multiple elements properly.

Scenario 8: Hash code when books has multiple elements and purchased is true

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeBooksMultipleElementsPurchasedTrue
