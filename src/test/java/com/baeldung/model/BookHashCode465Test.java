```
Scenario 1: HashCode Calculation for All Non-Null Fields

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeAllNonNullFields
  Description: This test verifies the hashCode method when all fields (author, isbn, and title) are non-null. It ensures that the hashCode is correctly calculated by including all the field values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with non-null values for author, isbn, and title.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the hashCode is correctly calculated based on the provided values.
Validation:
  Verify that the calculated hashCode includes the hash codes of all non-null fields. This ensures the method correctly computes the combined hash code for non-null fields.

Scenario 2: HashCode Calculation for Null Author Field

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeNullAuthorField
  Description: This test verifies the hashCode method when the author field is null. It ensures that the hashCode calculation correctly handles a null author.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a null value for author and non-null values for isbn and title.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the hashCode is correctly calculated by excluding the null author.
Validation:
  Verify that the calculated hashCode correctly excludes the null author field. This ensures the method handles null values appropriately.

Scenario 3: HashCode Calculation for Null ISBN Field

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeNullIsbnField
  Description: This test verifies the hashCode method when the isbn field is null. It ensures that the hashCode calculation correctly handles a null isbn.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a null value for isbn and non-null values for author and title.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the hashCode is correctly calculated by excluding the null isbn.
Validation:
  Verify that the calculated hashCode correctly excludes the null isbn field. This ensures the method handles null values appropriately.

Scenario 4: HashCode Calculation for Null Title Field

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeNullTitleField
  Description: This test verifies the hashCode method when the title field is null. It ensures that the hashCode calculation correctly handles a null title.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a null value for title and non-null values for author and isbn.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the hashCode is correctly calculated by excluding the null title.
Validation:
  Verify that the calculated hashCode correctly excludes the null title field. This ensures the method handles null values appropriately.

Scenario 5: HashCode Calculation for All Null Fields

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeAllNullFields
  Description: This test verifies the hashCode method when all fields (author, isbn, and title) are null. It ensures that the hashCode calculation correctly handles all null fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with null values for author, isbn, and title.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the hashCode is correctly calculated by excluding all null fields.
Validation:
  Verify that the calculated hashCode is based solely on the prime number and initial result value when all fields are null. This ensures the method handles all-null cases appropriately.

Scenario 6: HashCode Calculation for Different Instances with Same Field Values

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeDifferentInstancesSameFieldValues
  Description: This test verifies the hashCode method for different instances of the class with identical field values. It ensures that the hashCode is the same for equivalent objects.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the class with the same values for author, isbn, and title.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both instances.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the hashCode results are the same for both instances.
Validation:
  Verify that identical objects produce the same hashCode result. This ensures the method correctly implements hashCode consistency for equivalent objects.

Scenario 7: HashCode Calculation for Different Instances with Different Field Values

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeDifferentInstancesDifferentFieldValues
  Description: This test verifies the hashCode method for different instances of the class with different field values. It ensures that the hashCode is different for non-equivalent objects.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the class with different values for author, isbn, and title.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both instances.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the hashCode results are different for both instances.
Validation:
  Verify that non-equivalent objects produce different hashCode results. This ensures the method correctly differentiates between distinct objects.

Scenario 8: HashCode Calculation for Same Instance Called Multiple Times

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeSameInstanceMultipleCalls
  Description: This test verifies the hashCode method when called multiple times on the same instance. It ensures that the hashCode remains consistent across multiple invocations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with specific values for author, isbn, and title.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method multiple times on the same instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the hashCode result is the same for each call.
Validation:
  Verify that the hashCode remains consistent across multiple calls on the same instance. This ensures the method adheres to the contract of consistent hash codes for an unchanged object.

Scenario 9: HashCode Calculation for Changing Field Values

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeChangingFieldValues
  Description: This test verifies the hashCode method when field values change after initial calculation. It ensures that the hashCode reflects changes in field values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with specific values for author, isbn, and title. Calculate the initial hashCode. Change one or more field values.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method after changing field values.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the hashCode result changes accordingly.
Validation:
  Verify that the hashCode reflects changes in field values. This ensures the method correctly updates the hash code based on the current state of the object.

Scenario 10: HashCode Calculation for Large Input Values

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeLargeInputValues
  Description: This test verifies the hashCode method when the fields contain large input values. It ensures that the hashCode calculation handles large strings efficiently.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with large string values for author, isbn, and title.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the hashCode is correctly calculated for large input values.
Validation:
  Verify that the hashCode method handles large input values efficiently without performance issues. This ensures the method's robustness for large data sets.
