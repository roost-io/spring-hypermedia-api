```
Scenario 1: Verify the method returns an empty list when books is initialized but empty

Details:
  TestName: getBooksReturnsEmptyListWhenBooksIsEmpty
  Description: This test checks if the getBooks method returns an empty list when the books list is initialized but contains no elements.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the books list as an empty ArrayList.
  Act: Invoke the getBooks method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned list is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly returns an empty list when there are no books. This is significant because it ensures that the method handles empty lists properly without throwing errors or returning null.

Scenario 2: Verify the method returns null when books is not initialized

Details:
  TestName: getBooksReturnsNullWhenBooksIsNotInitialized
  Description: This test checks if the getBooks method returns null when the books list is not initialized (remains as null).
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure the books list is not initialized (remains null).
  Act: Invoke the getBooks method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly returns null when the books list is not initialized. This is important to check the method's behavior in uninitialized states.

Scenario 3: Verify the method returns a list with multiple books when books is populated

Details:
  TestName: getBooksReturnsListWithMultipleBooks
  Description: This test checks if the getBooks method returns a list containing multiple Book objects when the books list is populated with several elements.
Execution:
  Arrange: Populate the books list with multiple Book objects.
  Act: Invoke the getBooks method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned list contains the same books that were added.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly returns a list containing all the books that were added. This ensures the method's functionality in scenarios where the list is populated.

Scenario 4: Verify the method returns a list with a single book when books contains one book

Details:
  TestName: getBooksReturnsListWithSingleBook
  Description: This test checks if the getBooks method returns a list containing a single Book object when the books list is populated with one element.
Execution:
  Arrange: Populate the books list with a single Book object.
  Act: Invoke the getBooks method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned list contains the same single book that was added.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly returns a list containing the single book that was added. This ensures the method's functionality when the list has only one element.

Scenario 5: Verify the method does not modify the original books list

Details:
  TestName: getBooksDoesNotModifyOriginalList
  Description: This test checks if the getBooks method does not modify the original books list when it is called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Populate the books list with some Book objects and store the original list.
  Act: Invoke the getBooks method and compare the returned list with the original.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the original list remains unchanged.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method does not alter the original books list. This is significant to ensure that the method maintains the integrity of the data.

Scenario 6: Verify the method handles concurrent modifications gracefully

Details:
  TestName: getBooksHandlesConcurrentModifications
  Description: This test checks if the getBooks method handles concurrent modifications to the books list gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the books list with some Book objects and set up a concurrent modification scenario.
  Act: Invoke the getBooks method while modifying the list concurrently.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check for any exceptions or errors.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method can handle concurrent modifications without throwing exceptions or errors. This is important for multi-threaded environments where the books list might be accessed and modified simultaneously.
