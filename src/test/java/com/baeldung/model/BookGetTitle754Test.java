Scenario 1: Test to check if getTitle returns the correct title

Details:  
TestName: getTitleReturnsCorrectValue.
Description: This test checks if the method getTitle() returns the correct title. 
Execution:
Arrange: N/A (No setup required as the method does not have any parameters).
Act: Invoke the getTitle() method.
Assert: Assert that the returned title matches the expected title.
Validation:
The assertion verifies that the getTitle() method returns the correct title. This is important to ensure that the correct title is retrieved when the method is called.

Scenario 2: Test to check if getTitle returns null when no title is set

Details:  
TestName: getTitleReturnsNullWhenNoTitleIsSet.
Description: This test checks if the method getTitle() returns null when no title is set. 
Execution:
Arrange: N/A (No setup required as the method does not have any parameters).
Act: Invoke the getTitle() method.
Assert: Assert that the returned title is null.
Validation:
The assertion verifies that the getTitle() method returns null when no title is set. This is important to handle scenarios where a title is not set for an object.

Scenario 3: Test to check if getTitle returns empty string when title is set to empty

Details:  
TestName: getTitleReturnsEmptyWhenTitleIsEmpty.
Description: This test checks if the method getTitle() returns an empty string when the title is set to empty. 
Execution:
Arrange: N/A (No setup required as the method does not have any parameters).
Act: Invoke the getTitle() method.
Assert: Assert that the returned title is an empty string.
Validation:
The assertion verifies that the getTitle() method returns an empty string when the title is set to empty. This is important to handle scenarios where a title is intentionally set to empty.

Please note: The test scenarios mentioned above are independent and need to be executed separately. Also, the test scenarios are based on the assumption that the 'title' is a property of the class where the 'getTitle' method is defined.
