"""
Scenario 1: Testing normal operation

Details:
  TestName: testGetTitleReturnsCorrectTitle.
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the getTitle method correctly returns the private member 'title' of the entity.
Execution:
  Arrange: In this case, there is no need to arrange any test data or mocks since the method does not accept any arguments and its operation is not dependent on the state of any other class or object apart from the 'title' member.
  Act: Invoke the getTitle method from a test object instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value matches the expected title value.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the getTitle method correctly retrieves the value of the 'title' member variable. The proper functioning of getter methods is important, as they enable the encapsulation principle of object-oriented programming.

Scenario 2: Testing behavior when title is null

Details:
  TestName: testGetTitleWhenTitleIsNull.
  Description: This test aims to check how the getTitle method behaves when the 'title' member is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set 'title' to null for the test object instance.
  Act: Call the getTitle method from this test object instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is null.
Validation:
  The assertion will confirm that getTitle can handle null values, returning null when the 'title' member is not set. This is important because it shows that the method does not crash or behave incorrectly when presented with null data.

Scenario 3: Testing unicode string as title

Details:
  TestName: testGetTitleWithUnicodeCharacters.
  Description: This test aims to check whether the getTitle method can handle titles that consist of unicode characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the 'title' member of the test object instance to a string that contains unicode characters.
  Act: Call the getTitle method from this test object instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the unicode string.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that getTitle can handle unicode characters correctly. This is important for internationalization and to ensure that users from all language backgrounds can use the application effectively.
