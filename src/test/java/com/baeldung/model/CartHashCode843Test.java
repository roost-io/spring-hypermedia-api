```
Scenario 1: Hash code calculation when books list is null and purchased is true.

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeBooksNullPurchasedTrue
  Description: This test checks the hash code calculation when the books list is null and the purchased flag is true.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the books list to null and the purchased flag to true.
  Act: Call the hashCode method.
  Assert: Compare the actual hash code result against the expected hash code value.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the hash code is correctly calculated using the prime number 31, and the purchased flag is true (contributing 1231 to the hash code). This test ensures the method handles null book lists correctly.

Scenario 2: Hash code calculation when books list is null and purchased is false.

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeBooksNullPurchasedFalse
  Description: This test checks the hash code calculation when the books list is null and the purchased flag is false.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the books list to null and the purchased flag to false.
  Act: Call the hashCode method.
  Assert: Compare the actual hash code result against the expected hash code value.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the hash code is correctly calculated using the prime number 31, and the purchased flag is false (contributing 1237 to the hash code). This test ensures the method handles null book lists correctly.

Scenario 3: Hash code calculation when books list is empty and purchased is true.

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeBooksEmptyPurchasedTrue
  Description: This test checks the hash code calculation when the books list is empty and the purchased flag is true.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the books list to an empty list and the purchased flag to true.
  Act: Call the hashCode method.
  Assert: Compare the actual hash code result against the expected hash code value.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the hash code is correctly calculated using the prime number 31, the hash code of an empty list, and the purchased flag is true. This test ensures the method handles empty book lists correctly.

Scenario 4: Hash code calculation when books list is empty and purchased is false.

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeBooksEmptyPurchasedFalse
  Description: This test checks the hash code calculation when the books list is empty and the purchased flag is false.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the books list to an empty list and the purchased flag to false.
  Act: Call the hashCode method.
  Assert: Compare the actual hash code result against the expected hash code value.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the hash code is correctly calculated using the prime number 31, the hash code of an empty list, and the purchased flag is false. This test ensures the method handles empty book lists correctly.

Scenario 5: Hash code calculation when books list has elements and purchased is true.

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeBooksWithElementsPurchasedTrue
  Description: This test checks the hash code calculation when the books list has elements and the purchased flag is true.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the books list to a list with some elements and the purchased flag to true.
  Act: Call the hashCode method.
  Assert: Compare the actual hash code result against the expected hash code value.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the hash code is correctly calculated using the prime number 31, the hash code of the non-empty list, and the purchased flag is true. This test ensures the method handles non-empty book lists correctly.

Scenario 6: Hash code calculation when books list has elements and purchased is false.

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeBooksWithElementsPurchasedFalse
  Description: This test checks the hash code calculation when the books list has elements and the purchased flag is false.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the books list to a list with some elements and the purchased flag to false.
  Act: Call the hashCode method.
  Assert: Compare the actual hash code result against the expected hash code value.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the hash code is correctly calculated using the prime number 31, the hash code of the non-empty list, and the purchased flag is false. This test ensures the method handles non-empty book lists correctly.

Scenario 7: Hash code calculation consistency.

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeConsistency
  Description: This test checks that the hash code calculation is consistent across multiple invocations with the same object state.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object with a specific books list and purchased flag state.
  Act: Call the hashCode method multiple times.
  Assert: Compare the hash code results from multiple invocations to ensure they are the same.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the hash code method produces consistent results for the same object state, ensuring the reliability of the hash code implementation.
