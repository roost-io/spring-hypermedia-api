Certainly! Below are the test scenarios for the `hashCode` method based on the provided class fields and imports:

```
Scenario 1: Hash code calculation with all fields as null

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeAllFieldsNull
  Description: Verify that the hash code calculation correctly handles the scenario when all fields are null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class with `author`, `isbn`, and `title` all set to null.
  Act: Call the `hashCode` method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hash code is equal to the expected value when all fields are null.
Validation:
  Verify that the hash code method properly handles null values and returns the expected result based on the formula. The expected result should be `prime * 1`, which is 31.

Scenario 2: Hash code calculation with non-null author

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeNonNullAuthor
  Description: Verify that the hash code calculation correctly includes the `author` field when it is non-null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class with `author` set to a non-null value and other fields as null.
  Act: Call the `hashCode` method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hash code matches the expected value based on the `author`'s hash code.
Validation:
  Verify that the hash code method correctly incorporates the `author` field's hash code into the final result. This ensures that individual fields are correctly included in the hash code computation.

Scenario 3: Hash code calculation with non-null isbn

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeNonNullIsbn
  Description: Verify that the hash code calculation correctly includes the `isbn` field when it is non-null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class with `isbn` set to a non-null value and other fields as null.
  Act: Call the `hashCode` method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hash code matches the expected value based on the `isbn`'s hash code.
Validation:
  Verify that the hash code method correctly incorporates the `isbn` field's hash code into the final result, ensuring proper inclusion of individual fields.

Scenario 4: Hash code calculation with non-null title

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeNonNullTitle
  Description: Verify that the hash code calculation correctly includes the `title` field when it is non-null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class with `title` set to a non-null value and other fields as null.
  Act: Call the `hashCode` method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hash code matches the expected value based on the `title`'s hash code.
Validation:
  Verify that the hash code method correctly incorporates the `title` field's hash code into the final result, ensuring proper inclusion of individual fields.

Scenario 5: Hash code calculation with all fields non-null

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeAllFieldsNonNull
  Description: Verify that the hash code calculation correctly includes all fields when they are non-null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class with `author`, `isbn`, and `title` all set to non-null values.
  Act: Call the `hashCode` method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hash code matches the expected value based on the hash codes of `author`, `isbn`, and `title`.
Validation:
  Verify that the hash code method correctly incorporates the hash codes of all non-null fields into the final result. This ensures that the method is functioning as intended when all fields are populated.

Scenario 6: Hash code consistency

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeConsistency
  Description: Verify that the hash code method consistently returns the same value when called multiple times on the same object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class with specific values for `author`, `isbn`, and `title`.
  Act: Call the `hashCode` method multiple times.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hash code is the same for each call.
Validation:
  Verify that the hash code method is consistent, returning the same value for the same object state. This is a fundamental property of the `hashCode` method in Java.

Scenario 7: Hash code uniqueness

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeUniqueness
  Description: Verify that the hash code method returns different values for objects with different field values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate two different objects with different values for `author`, `isbn`, and `title`.
  Act: Call the `hashCode` method on both objects.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hash codes are different.
Validation:
  Verify that the hash code method provides unique hash codes for objects with different states, ensuring proper distribution and reducing the likelihood of collisions in hash-based collections.

Scenario 8: Hash code with some fields null and some non-null

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeMixedFields
  Description: Verify that the hash code calculation correctly handles a mix of null and non-null fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class with `author` and `isbn` set to non-null values and `title` set to null.
  Act: Call the `hashCode` method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hash code matches the expected value based on the hash codes of `author` and `isbn`.
Validation:
  Verify that the hash code method correctly incorporates the hash codes of non-null fields while handling null fields appropriately. This ensures the method's robustness in partial data scenarios.
```

These scenarios cover various cases, including null values, non-null values, mixed values, and consistency checks, ensuring comprehensive testing of the `hashCode` method.
