Scenario 1: Test when purchased is false

Details:
    TestName: testIsPurchasedWhenFalse
    Description: This test is meant to check the isPurchased() method when its value is false. The target scenario is when the product has not been purchased.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the isPurchased value to false.
    Act: Invoke the isPurchased method.
    Assert: Check if the returned value is false.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the returned value matches the expected result (false). This is significant because it validates the functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Test when purchased is true

Details:
    TestName: testIsPurchasedWhenTrue
    Description: This test is meant to check the isPurchased() method when its value is true. The target scenario is when the product has been purchased.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the isPurchased value to true.
    Act: Invoke the isPurchased method.
    Assert: Check if the returned value is true.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the returned value from the method matches the expected result (true). This is significant because it allows us to see that the method correctly identifies when a product has been purchased.

Scenario 3: Testing with no initialization

Details:
    TestName: testIsPurchasedWithoutInitialization
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the isPurchased() method when the variable hasn't been initialized. The target scenario is when the purchased variable was not initialized.
  Execution:
    Arrange: There is no need to setup any data since the variable was not initialized.
    Act: Invoke the isPurchased method.
    Assert: Check if the method returns 'false' as this is the default value for uninitialized boolean variables in Java.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that when the isPurchased method is called without initializing the 'purchased' variable, it returns 'false', which is the default value for uninitialized boolean variables.
