```
Scenario 1: Compare Cart object with itself

Details:
  TestName: compareCartWithItself
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies that a Cart object is equal to itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Cart object with some initial values.
  Act: Invoke the equals method with the same Cart object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method returns true.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the equals method correctly handles the scenario where the object is compared to itself, which should always return true.

Scenario 2: Compare Cart object with null

Details:
  TestName: compareCartWithNull
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies that a Cart object is not equal to null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Cart object with some initial values.
  Act: Invoke the equals method with null.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method returns false.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the equals method correctly handles the scenario where the object is compared to null, which should always return false.

Scenario 3: Compare Cart objects of different classes

Details:
  TestName: compareCartWithDifferentClass
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies that a Cart object is not equal to an object of a different class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Cart object and an object of a different class (e.g., String).
  Act: Invoke the equals method with the object of a different class.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method returns false.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the equals method correctly handles the scenario where the object is compared to an object of a different class, which should always return false.

Scenario 4: Compare two Cart objects with same books and purchased values

Details:
  TestName: compareCartsWithSameValues
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies that two Cart objects with the same books and purchased values are equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Cart objects with the same books and purchased values.
  Act: Invoke the equals method to compare the two Cart objects.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method returns true.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the equals method correctly handles the scenario where two Cart objects have the same values, which should return true.

Scenario 5: Compare two Cart objects with different books values

Details:
  TestName: compareCartsWithDifferentBooks
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies that two Cart objects with different books values are not equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Cart objects with different books values.
  Act: Invoke the equals method to compare the two Cart objects.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method returns false.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the equals method correctly handles the scenario where two Cart objects have different books values, which should return false.

Scenario 6: Compare two Cart objects with different purchased values

Details:
  TestName: compareCartsWithDifferentPurchased
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies that two Cart objects with different purchased values are not equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Cart objects with the same books values but different purchased values.
  Act: Invoke the equals method to compare the two Cart objects.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method returns false.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the equals method correctly handles the scenario where two Cart objects have different purchased values, which should return false.

Scenario 7: Compare two Cart objects with null books values

Details:
  TestName: compareCartsWithNullBooks
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies that two Cart objects with null books values are equal if their purchased values are the same.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Cart objects with null books values and the same purchased values.
  Act: Invoke the equals method to compare the two Cart objects.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method returns true.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the equals method correctly handles the scenario where two Cart objects have null books values but the same purchased values, which should return true.

Scenario 8: Compare two Cart objects where one has null books and the other has non-null books

Details:
  TestName: compareCartWithNullAndNonNullBooks
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies that a Cart object with null books is not equal to a Cart object with non-null books.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create one Cart object with null books and another Cart object with non-null books.
  Act: Invoke the equals method to compare the two Cart objects.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method returns false.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the equals method correctly handles the scenario where one Cart object has null books and the other has non-null books, which should return false.

roost_feedback [5/28/2024, 9:51:20 AM]:cart class does not have setBooks() method, instead use add() that accepts a Book object
Replace cart.setBooks() call with cart.add(new Book())
