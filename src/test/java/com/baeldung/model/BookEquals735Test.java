```
Scenario 1: Objects are the Same Instance

Details:
  TestName: objectsAreSameInstance
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly returns true when comparing the object to itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Book class.
  Act: Invoke the equals method with the same instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method returns true when the object is compared to itself, which is a fundamental property of the equals contract.

Scenario 2: Comparing with Null Object

Details:
  TestName: comparingWithNullObject
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly returns false when comparing the object to null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Book class.
  Act: Invoke the equals method with null as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method returns false when the object is compared to null, ensuring that null comparisons are handled correctly.

Scenario 3: Comparing with Different Class Object

Details:
  TestName: comparingWithDifferentClassObject
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly returns false when comparing the object to an instance of a different class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Book class and an instance of a different class (e.g., String).
  Act: Invoke the equals method with the instance of the different class.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method returns false when the object is compared to an instance of a different class, ensuring type safety.

Scenario 4: Comparing with Object with All Fields Null

Details:
  TestName: comparingWithObjectWithAllFieldsNull
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly returns true when comparing two objects of the Book class with all fields set to null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the Book class with all fields set to null.
  Act: Invoke the equals method with one instance as the parameter of the other.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method returns true when comparing two objects with all fields set to null, confirming that null fields are handled correctly.

Scenario 5: Comparing with Object with Different Author

Details:
  TestName: comparingWithObjectWithDifferentAuthor
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly returns false when comparing two objects of the Book class with different author fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the Book class with different author fields.
  Act: Invoke the equals method with one instance as the parameter of the other.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method returns false when the author fields are different, ensuring that the author field is considered in equality checks.

Scenario 6: Comparing with Object with Different ISBN

Details:
  TestName: comparingWithObjectWithDifferentIsbn
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly returns false when comparing two objects of the Book class with different ISBN fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the Book class with different ISBN fields.
  Act: Invoke the equals method with one instance as the parameter of the other.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method returns false when the ISBN fields are different, ensuring that the ISBN field is considered in equality checks.

Scenario 7: Comparing with Object with Different Title

Details:
  TestName: comparingWithObjectWithDifferentTitle
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly returns false when comparing two objects of the Book class with different title fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the Book class with different title fields.
  Act: Invoke the equals method with one instance as the parameter of the other.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method returns false when the title fields are different, ensuring that the title field is considered in equality checks.

Scenario 8: Comparing with Object with All Fields Same

Details:
  TestName: comparingWithObjectWithAllFieldsSame
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly returns true when comparing two objects of the Book class with all fields being the same.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the Book class with the same values for author, ISBN, and title fields.
  Act: Invoke the equals method with one instance as the parameter of the other.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method returns true when all fields are the same, confirming that the method correctly identifies equal objects.
