```
Scenario 1: Adding a Book to an Empty List

Details:
  TestName: addBookToEmptyList
  Description: This test verifies that a book is correctly added to an initially empty list of books.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `books` list as an empty `ArrayList`, create a new `Book` object.
  Act: Call the `add` method with the newly created `Book` object.
  Assert: Check that the `books` list now contains exactly one book, and that the book is the one that was added.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method correctly adds a book to an empty list, which is a fundamental functionality of the `add` method.

Scenario 2: Adding a Book to a Non-Empty List

Details:
  TestName: addBookToNonEmptyList
  Description: This test verifies that a book is correctly added to a list that already contains books.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `books` list with some pre-existing `Book` objects, create a new `Book` object.
  Act: Call the `add` method with the newly created `Book` object.
  Assert: Check that the `books` list contains one more book than before, and that the new book is the one that was added.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method can correctly add a book to a list that is not empty, maintaining the integrity of the list.

Scenario 3: Adding a Null Book

Details:
  TestName: addNullBook
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the `add` method when a null book is added.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `books` list as an empty `ArrayList`.
  Act: Call the `add` method with `null`.
  Assert: Check that the `books` list still has zero books or verify how the method handles null values if it throws an exception or ignores the null.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method handles null inputs gracefully, which is important for robustness and error handling.

Scenario 4: Adding a Book When List is Null

Details:
  TestName: addBookWhenListIsNull
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the `add` method when the `books` list is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure that the `books` list is set to `null`, create a new `Book` object.
  Act: Call the `add` method with the newly created `Book` object.
  Assert: Check if the method throws a `NullPointerException` or initializes the list before adding the book.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method can handle the scenario where the `books` list is initially null, which is important for preventing runtime exceptions.

Scenario 5: Adding Multiple Books

Details:
  TestName: addMultipleBooks
  Description: This test verifies that multiple books can be added to the list one after another.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `books` list as an empty `ArrayList`, create multiple `Book` objects.
  Act: Call the `add` method multiple times with different `Book` objects.
  Assert: Check that the `books` list contains all the books that were added, in the correct order.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method can handle multiple additions correctly, maintaining the order and integrity of the list.

Scenario 6: Adding a Book After Purchase

Details:
  TestName: addBookAfterPurchase
  Description: This test verifies whether a book can be added to the list after a purchase has been made (assuming the `purchased` flag has significance).
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `books` list as an empty `ArrayList`, set `purchased` to `true`, create a new `Book` object.
  Act: Call the `add` method with the newly created `Book` object.
  Assert: Check whether the book is added to the list or if any restrictions are applied due to the `purchased` flag.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method behaves correctly in the context of the `purchased` flag, which might represent a business rule or logic.

Scenario 7: Adding a Duplicate Book

Details:
  TestName: addDuplicateBook
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the `add` method when a duplicate book (same object) is added.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `books` list with one `Book` object, then create a reference to the same `Book` object.
  Act: Call the `add` method with the duplicate `Book` object.
  Assert: Check whether the list contains both instances of the book or handles duplicates in a specific way.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method handles duplicate entries correctly, which could be important for maintaining data integrity.
