```
Scenario 1: Check equality with the same object

Details:
  TestName: checkEqualityWithSameObject
  Description: This test ensures that the equals method returns true when compared to the same object reference.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Book object.
  Act: Call the equals method on the object with itself as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method returns true.
Validation:
  Verifies that the equals method correctly identifies when it is comparing the same object instance, returning true as expected.

Scenario 2: Check equality with null

Details:
  TestName: checkEqualityWithNull
  Description: This test ensures that the equals method returns false when the object is compared to null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Book object.
  Act: Call the equals method on the object with null as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method returns false.
Validation:
  Verifies that the equals method correctly identifies when it is comparing with a null reference, returning false as expected.

Scenario 3: Check equality with different class object

Details:
  TestName: checkEqualityWithDifferentClassObject
  Description: This test ensures that the equals method returns false when compared to an object of a different class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Book object. Create an object of a different class (e.g., String).
  Act: Call the equals method on the Book object with the different class object as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method returns false.
Validation:
  Verifies that the equals method correctly identifies when it is comparing with an object of a different class, returning false as expected.

Scenario 4: Check equality with a different Book object with all fields null

Details:
  TestName: checkEqualityWithDifferentBookObjectAllFieldsNull
  Description: This test ensures that the equals method returns true when compared to another Book object with all fields set to null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Book objects with all fields (id, isbn, author, title) set to null.
  Act: Call the equals method on one Book object with the other Book object as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method returns true.
Validation:
  Verifies that the equals method correctly identifies when it is comparing with another Book object with all fields set to null, returning true as expected.

Scenario 5: Check equality with a different Book object with same values

Details:
  TestName: checkEqualityWithDifferentBookObjectSameValues
  Description: This test ensures that the equals method returns true when compared to another Book object with the same values for all fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Book objects with the same values for id, isbn, author, and title.
  Act: Call the equals method on one Book object with the other Book object as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method returns true.
Validation:
  Verifies that the equals method correctly identifies when it is comparing with another Book object with the same values for all fields, returning true as expected.

Scenario 6: Check equality with a different Book object with different author

Details:
  TestName: checkEqualityWithDifferentAuthor
  Description: This test ensures that the equals method returns false when compared to another Book object with a different author.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Book objects where all fields are the same except for the author field.
  Act: Call the equals method on one Book object with the other Book object as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method returns false.
Validation:
  Verifies that the equals method correctly identifies when it is comparing with another Book object with a different author, returning false as expected.

Scenario 7: Check equality with a different Book object with different isbn

Details:
  TestName: checkEqualityWithDifferentIsbn
  Description: This test ensures that the equals method returns false when compared to another Book object with a different isbn.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Book objects where all fields are the same except for the isbn field.
  Act: Call the equals method on one Book object with the other Book object as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method returns false.
Validation:
  Verifies that the equals method correctly identifies when it is comparing with another Book object with a different isbn, returning false as expected.

Scenario 8: Check equality with a different Book object with different title

Details:
  TestName: checkEqualityWithDifferentTitle
  Description: This test ensures that the equals method returns false when compared to another Book object with a different title.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Book objects where all fields are the same except for the title field.
  Act: Call the equals method on one Book object with the other Book object as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method returns false.
Validation:
  Verifies that the equals method correctly identifies when it is comparing with another Book object with a different title, returning false as expected.

Scenario 9: Check equality with a different Book object with one null field

Details:
  TestName: checkEqualityWithOneNullField
  Description: This test ensures that the equals method returns false when compared to another Book object with one null field while the other has a non-null value for the same field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Book objects where one object has a null field (e.g., author) and the other has a non-null value for the same field.
  Act: Call the equals method on one Book object with the other Book object as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method returns false.
Validation:
  Verifies that the equals method correctly identifies when it is comparing with another Book object where one object has a null field and the other has a non-null value for the same field, returning false as expected.

Scenario 10: Check equality with a different Book object with all fields different

Details:
  TestName: checkEqualityWithAllFieldsDifferent
  Description: This test ensures that the equals method returns false when compared to another Book object with all fields having different values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Book objects where all fields (id, isbn, author, title) have different values.
  Act: Call the equals method on one Book object with the other Book object as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method returns false.
Validation:
  Verifies that the equals method correctly identifies when it is comparing with another Book object with all fields having different values, returning false as expected.
