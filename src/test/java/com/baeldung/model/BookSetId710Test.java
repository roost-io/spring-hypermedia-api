"""
Scenario 1: Setting a Valid ID

Details:
  TestName: settingValidId
  Description: This test verifies that the `setId` method correctly assigns a valid Long ID to the `id` field of the object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the `setId` method. Define a valid Long ID value.
  Act: Call the `setId` method with the valid Long ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the `id` field of the object matches the assigned Long ID.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the method correctly updates the object's `id` field when provided with a valid Long ID. This is essential for ensuring that the object can store and retrieve its ID correctly.

"""

"""

  Description: This test checks how the `setId` method handles a null ID value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the `setId` method.
  Act: Call the `setId` method with a null value.

Scenario 5: Setting Maximum Long Value as ID

Details:
  TestName: settingMaxLongId
  Description: This test verifies that the `setId` method correctly assigns the maximum possible Long value as the ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the `setId` method. Define a Long ID value of `Long.MAX_VALUE`.
  Act: Call the `setId` method with the `Long.MAX_VALUE`.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the `id` field of the object matches the assigned `Long.MAX_VALUE`.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the method can handle the maximum Long value, ensuring that the object can store and retrieve its ID even at the upper limit of the Long data type. This is crucial for testing the boundaries of the method's input range.

"""

"""
Scenario 6: Consecutive ID Setting

Details:
  TestName: consecutiveIdSetting
  Description: This test verifies that the `setId` method can handle consecutive calls with different ID values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the `setId` method. Define two different Long ID values.
  Act: Call the `setId` method with the first Long ID, then call it again with the second Long ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the `id` field of the object matches the second Long ID after both calls.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the method can update the `id` field consecutively, ensuring that the object can handle multiple ID assignments correctly. This is important for scenarios where the ID might change over time.

"""

"""
Scenario 7: Setting Minimum Long Value as ID

Details:
  TestName: settingMinLongId
  Description: This test verifies that the `setId` method correctly assigns the minimum possible Long value as the ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the `setId` method. Define a Long ID value of `Long.MIN_VALUE`.
  Act: Call the `setId` method with the `Long.MIN_VALUE`.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the `id` field of the object matches the assigned `Long.MIN_VALUE`.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the method can handle the minimum Long value, ensuring that the object can store and retrieve its ID even at the lower limit of the Long data type. This is crucial for testing the boundaries of the method's input range.

"""

"""
Scenario 8: Setting ID After Object Initialization

Details:
  TestName: settingIdAfterInitialization
  Description: This test verifies that the `setId` method correctly assigns an ID value after the object has been initialized.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the `setId` method. Ensure that the object is in an initialized state.
  Act: Call the `setId` method with a valid Long ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the `id` field of the object matches the assigned Long ID.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the method can assign an ID value correctly even after the object has been initialized, ensuring that the object's state can be updated as needed.

"""

"""
Scenario 9: Setting ID on a Null Object

Details:
  TestName: settingIdOnNullObject
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the `setId` method when called on a null object reference.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a null object reference of the class containing the `setId` method.
  Act: Attempt to call the `setId` method on the null object reference.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that a `NullPointerException` is thrown.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that calling the `setId` method on a null object reference results in a `NullPointerException`, ensuring that the method handles null object references appropriately by throwing the expected exception.

"""

"""
Scenario 10: Setting ID with a Mock Object

Details:
  TestName: settingIdWithMockObject
  Description: This test verifies that the `setId` method correctly assigns an ID value when using a mock object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock object of the class containing the `setId` method using a mocking framework (e.g., Mockito). Define a valid Long ID value.
  Act: Call the `setId` method on the mock object with the valid Long ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the `id` field of the mock object matches the assigned Long ID.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the method can interact correctly with mock objects, ensuring that the method's behavior is consistent even when used in a testing environment with mock dependencies.

"""

"""
Scenario 11: Setting ID with a JSON View Annotation

Details:
  TestName: settingIdWithJsonView
  Description: This test verifies that the `setId` method works correctly when the class is annotated with a JSON view.
Execution:

  Act: Call the `setId` method with the valid Long ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the `id` field of the object matches the assigned Long ID and that the JSON view is correctly applied.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the method works correctly with JSON view annotations, ensuring that the object's `id` field can be set and serialized/deserialized correctly in a JSON context.

"""

"""
Scenario 12: Setting ID with a Column Annotation

Details:
  TestName: settingIdWithColumnAnnotation
  Description: This test verifies that the `setId` method works correctly when the `id` field is annotated with `@Column`.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the `setId` method and annotated with `@Column`. Define a valid Long ID value.
  Act: Call the `setId` method with the valid Long ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the `id` field of the object matches the assigned Long ID and that the `@Column` annotation is correctly applied.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the method works correctly with `@Column` annotations, ensuring that the object's `id` field can be set and persisted correctly in a database context.
