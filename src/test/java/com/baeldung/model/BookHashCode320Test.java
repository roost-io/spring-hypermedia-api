Certainly! Below are the test scenarios for the `hashCode` method based on the provided class fields and imports:

```
Scenario 1: Hash code calculation with all fields null

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeWithAllFieldsNull
  Description: Verify that the hash code calculation correctly handles the scenario when all fields are null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class with `author`, `isbn`, and `title` all set to null.
  Act: Call the `hashCode` method.
  Assert: Compare the returned hash code with the expected value (1).
Validation:
  Ensure that the method correctly returns the hash code when all fields are null, which should be the initial value of `result` (i.e., 1).
  This test is significant to verify the default behavior when no fields are set.

Scenario 2: Hash code calculation with non-null author

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeWithNonNullAuthor
  Description: Verify that the hash code calculation correctly incorporates the `author` field when it is non-null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class with `author` set to a non-null value (e.g., "John Doe") and other fields null.
  Act: Call the `hashCode` method.
  Assert: Compare the returned hash code with the expected value based on the `author`'s hash code.
Validation:
  Ensure that the method correctly incorporates the `author` field's hash code into the overall hash code calculation.
  This test is important to validate that individual fields contribute correctly to the hash code.

Scenario 3: Hash code calculation with non-null isbn

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeWithNonNullIsbn
  Description: Verify that the hash code calculation correctly incorporates the `isbn` field when it is non-null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class with `isbn` set to a non-null value (e.g., "1234567890") and other fields null.
  Act: Call the `hashCode` method.
  Assert: Compare the returned hash code with the expected value based on the `isbn`'s hash code.
Validation:
  Ensure that the method correctly incorporates the `isbn` field's hash code into the overall hash code calculation.
  This test is important to validate that individual fields contribute correctly to the hash code.

Scenario 4: Hash code calculation with non-null title

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeWithNonNullTitle
  Description: Verify that the hash code calculation correctly incorporates the `title` field when it is non-null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class with `title` set to a non-null value (e.g., "Sample Title") and other fields null.
  Act: Call the `hashCode` method.
  Assert: Compare the returned hash code with the expected value based on the `title`'s hash code.
Validation:
  Ensure that the method correctly incorporates the `title` field's hash code into the overall hash code calculation.
  This test is important to validate that individual fields contribute correctly to the hash code.

Scenario 5: Hash code calculation with all fields non-null

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeWithAllFieldsNonNull
  Description: Verify that the hash code calculation correctly incorporates all fields when they are non-null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class with `author`, `isbn`, and `title` set to non-null values.
  Act: Call the `hashCode` method.
  Assert: Compare the returned hash code with the expected value based on the hash codes of all fields combined.
Validation:
  Ensure that the method correctly incorporates all fields' hash codes into the overall hash code calculation.
  This test is significant to validate the comprehensive behavior of the hash code method when all fields are set.

Scenario 6: Hash code consistency with same field values

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeConsistencyWithSameFieldValues
  Description: Verify that the hash code calculation consistently returns the same value for objects with the same field values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate two objects of the class with identical `author`, `isbn`, and `title` values.
  Act: Call the `hashCode` method on both objects.
  Assert: Compare the returned hash codes from both objects to ensure they are equal.
Validation:
  Ensure that objects with the same field values produce the same hash code.
  This test is significant to verify the consistency requirement of the hash code method.

Scenario 7: Hash code variation with different field values

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeVariationWithDifferentFieldValues
  Description: Verify that the hash code calculation returns different values for objects with different field values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate two objects of the class with different `author`, `isbn`, and `title` values.
  Act: Call the `hashCode` method on both objects.
  Assert: Compare the returned hash codes from both objects to ensure they are not equal.
Validation:
  Ensure that objects with different field values produce different hash codes.
  This test is significant to verify the uniqueness requirement of the hash code method.

Scenario 8: Hash code calculation with some fields null and others non-null

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeWithSomeFieldsNull
  Description: Verify that the hash code calculation correctly handles a mix of null and non-null fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class with a mix of null and non-null values for `author`, `isbn`, and `title`.
  Act: Call the `hashCode` method.
  Assert: Compare the returned hash code with the expected value based on the non-null fields' hash codes.
Validation:
  Ensure that the method correctly incorporates the non-null fields' hash codes and handles null fields appropriately.
  This test is important to validate the method's behavior with partial data.

Scenario 9: Hash code calculation with special characters in fields

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: Verify that the hash code calculation correctly handles fields containing special characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class with `author`, `isbn`, and `title` containing special characters.
  Act: Call the `hashCode` method.
  Assert: Compare the returned hash code with the expected value based on the fields' hash codes.
Validation:
  Ensure that the method correctly incorporates fields with special characters into the hash code calculation.
  This test is significant to verify the robustness of the hash code method with diverse input.

Scenario 10: Hash code calculation with very long strings in fields

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeWithVeryLongStrings
  Description: Verify that the hash code calculation correctly handles fields containing very long strings.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class with `author`, `isbn`, and `title` containing very long strings (e.g., 1000+ characters).
  Act: Call the `hashCode` method.
  Assert: Compare the returned hash code with the expected value based on the long strings' hash codes.
Validation:
  Ensure that the method correctly incorporates fields with very long strings into the hash code calculation.
  This test is significant to verify the performance and correctness of the hash code method with large input data.
