Scenario 1: Test to verify regular functionality of getLanguage method

  Details:
    TestName: checkGetLanguageOperation
    Description: The test is meant to check the normal and regular functionality of the getLanguage method to ensure it returns the appropriate language string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Not required, as the language string is already set.
    Act: Invoke the getLanguage method.
    Assert: Compare the returned language string from the getLanguage method with the expected language string.
  Validation:
    Assertion aims at verifying the correctness of the getLanguage method in retrieving the 'language' information.
    The test is significant for verifying the basic functionality of the getLanguage method ensuring it correctly fetches the language of the instance.

Scenario 2: Test to verify consistency of getLanguage method for same instance

  Details:
    TestName: consistencyCheckOnSameInstance
    Description: The test aims at verifying the consistency of the getLanguage method for the same instance, specifically focusing on the scenario where the getLanguage method must return constant results for the same instance.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Not required, as the language string is already set.
    Act: Invoke the getLanguage method twice or more on the same instance.
    Assert: Compare the obtained strings from every getLanguage invocation ensuring they are the same.
  Validation:
    The assertion is meant to validate the immutability and consistency of the getLanguage method for a single object instance.
    This test is crucial in guaranteeing the consistency of the getLanguage method for maintaining object state.

Scenario 3: Null Test

  Details:
    TestName: nullLanguageTest
    Description: This test focuses on the scenario where the language has not been initialized (is null). The test is meant to check the functionality of the getLanguage method when the language variable is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the instance but do not set any language.
    Act: Invoke the getLanguage method.
    Assert: Check if the returned value is null.
  Validation:
    The Assertion is meant to verify the functionality of getLanguage when the language is not set.
    This test is crucial for handling cases when the language of the instance hasn't been initialized.

Please note that the provided method is a simple accessor (getter) method, and typically these do not undergo extensive testing as they don't hold any logic. However, it is essential to ensure they are returning the expected data.
