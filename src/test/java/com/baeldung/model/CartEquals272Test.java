```
Scenario 1: Compare Cart object with itself

Details:
  TestName: compareCartWithItself
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies that a Cart object is equal to itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Cart object.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on the Cart object, passing itself as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method returns true.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the equals method correctly handles the reflexive property of equality, which is fundamental for the equals contract.

Scenario 2: Compare Cart object with null

Details:
  TestName: compareCartWithNull
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies that a Cart object is not equal to null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Cart object.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on the Cart object, passing null as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method returns false.
Validation:
  This assertion ensures that the equals method correctly handles comparisons with null, which is a common edge case.

Scenario 3: Compare Cart object with an object of a different class

Details:
  TestName: compareCartWithDifferentClassObject
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies that a Cart object is not equal to an object of a different class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Cart object and an object of a different class (e.g., a String object).
  Act: Invoke the equals method on the Cart object, passing the different class object as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method returns false.
Validation:
  This assertion ensures that the equals method correctly handles comparisons with objects of different classes, adhering to the equals contract.

Scenario 4: Compare two Cart objects with identical books and purchased status

Details:
  TestName: compareIdenticalCartObjects
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies that two Cart objects with identical books and purchased status are equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Cart objects with the same books list and purchased status.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on the first Cart object, passing the second Cart object as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method returns true.
Validation:
  This assertion ensures that the equals method correctly handles comparisons between two identical Cart objects, verifying the equality based on their state.

Scenario 5: Compare two Cart objects with different books

Details:
  TestName: compareCartsWithDifferentBooks
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies that two Cart objects with different books lists are not equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Cart objects with different books lists but the same purchased status.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on the first Cart object, passing the second Cart object as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method returns false.
Validation:
  This assertion ensures that the equals method correctly handles comparisons between two Cart objects with different books lists, verifying inequality based on the books field.

Scenario 6: Compare two Cart objects with different purchased status

Details:
  TestName: compareCartsWithDifferentPurchasedStatus
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies that two Cart objects with different purchased statuses are not equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Cart objects with the same books list but different purchased statuses.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on the first Cart object, passing the second Cart object as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method returns false.
Validation:
  This assertion ensures that the equals method correctly handles comparisons between two Cart objects with different purchased statuses, verifying inequality based on the purchased field.

Scenario 7: Compare two Cart objects with one having null books and the other having a non-null books list

Details:
  TestName: compareCartWithNullBooksAndNonNullBooks
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies that a Cart object with a null books list is not equal to a Cart object with a non-null books list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create one Cart object with a null books list and another Cart object with a non-null books list.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on the first Cart object, passing the second Cart object as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method returns false.
Validation:
  This assertion ensures that the equals method correctly handles comparisons between Cart objects where one has a null books list and the other has a non-null books list.

Scenario 8: Compare two Cart objects with both having null books lists

Details:
  TestName: compareCartsWithBothNullBooks
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies that two Cart objects with null books lists and the same purchased status are equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Cart objects, both with null books lists and the same purchased status.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on the first Cart object, passing the second Cart object as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the method returns true.
Validation:
  This assertion ensures that the equals method correctly handles comparisons between two Cart objects where both have null books lists, verifying equality based on the books field being null in both cases.
