ROOST_METHOD_HASH=equals_fabed3cd0d
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=equals_039c844c47

Scenario 1: Test when both object instances are the same

  Details:
    TestName: equalsSameInstance
    Description: This test is meant to check if the equals() method returns true when called with the same instance of the object as the parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create or retrieve a Book instance.
    Act: Call the equals() method, providing the same instance as the parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the outcome is true.
  Validation:
    The equals method should return true if the input parameter is the same instance as the instance the method was called on. This is part of the contract of the equals method in Java.

Scenario 2: Test when the parameter is null

  Details:
    TestName: equalsNullParameter
    Description: This test is meant to check if the equals() method returns false when called with null as the parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create or retrieve a Book instance.
    Act: Call the equals() method, providing null as the parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the outcome is false.
  Validation:
    The equals method should return false if the input parameter is null. This is part of the contract of the equals method in Java.

Scenario 3: Test when the classes of the two objects are not the same

  Details:
    TestName: equalsDifferentClasses
    Description: This test is meant to check if the equals() method returns false when called with an instance of a different class.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create or retrieve a Book instance and an instance of a different class.
    Act: Call the equals() method, providing the instance of the different class as the parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the outcome is false.
  Validation:
    The equals method should return false if the input parameter is an instance of a different class. This adheres to the contract of the equals method in Java.

Scenario 4: Test when Books have the same author, isbn, and title

  Details:
    TestName: equalsSameAttributes
    Description: This test is meant to check if the equals() method returns true when both Book instances have the same author, isbn, and title attributes.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Book instances with identical author, isbn, and title.
    Act: Call the equals() method, providing the second Book instance as the parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the outcome is true.
  Validation:
    The equals method should return true if the input parameter is an instance of the same class and all attributes match. This follows the business logic of defining what makes two Books "equal".

Scenario 5: Test when Books have different authors, isbn, or title

  Details:
    TestName: equalsDifferentAttributes
    Description: This test is meant to check if the equals() method returns false when the two Book instances have different author, isbn, or title attributes.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Book instances where either author, isbn, or title differs.
    Act: Call the equals() method, providing the second Book instance as the parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the outcome is false.
  Validation:
    The equals method should return false if the input parameter is an instance of the same class but any attribute doesn't match. This tests the differentiation logic within the equals method.
