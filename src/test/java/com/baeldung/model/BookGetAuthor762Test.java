"""
Scenario 1: Validate the retrieval of the author when the author is set.

Details:
  TestName: getAuthorWhenAuthorIsSet
  Description: This test checks if the `getAuthor` method correctly retrieves the author's name when the author's name is set in the object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the author's name to a specific value.
  Act: Call the `getAuthor` method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned author's name matches the value that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly retrieves the author's name. This test is significant to ensure that the `getAuthor` method returns the expected value when the author is set.

Scenario 2: Validate the retrieval of the author when the author is not set (null).

Details:
  TestName: getAuthorWhenAuthorIsNull
  Description: This test checks if the `getAuthor` method returns `null` when the author's name is not set in the object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class without setting the author's name.
  Act: Call the `getAuthor` method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned author's name is `null`.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method handles the case where the author's name is not set. This test is significant for ensuring that the method does not throw an exception or return an incorrect value when the author's name is null.

Scenario 3: Validate the retrieval of the author when the author is set to an empty string.

Details:
  TestName: getAuthorWhenAuthorIsEmpty
  Description: This test checks if the `getAuthor` method returns an empty string when the author's name is set to an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the author's name to an empty string.
  Act: Call the `getAuthor` method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned author's name is an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles the case where the author's name is an empty string. This test is significant to ensure that the method does not alter or mishandle empty string values.

Scenario 4: Validate the retrieval of the author when the author is set to a whitespace string.

Details:
  TestName: getAuthorWhenAuthorIsWhitespace
  Description: This test checks if the `getAuthor` method returns a whitespace string when the author's name is set to a whitespace string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the author's name to a whitespace string.
  Act: Call the `getAuthor` method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned author's name is the same whitespace string that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles whitespace strings. This test is significant to ensure that the method does not ignore or incorrectly process whitespace values.

Scenario 5: Validate the retrieval of the author when the author contains special characters.

Details:
  TestName: getAuthorWhenAuthorHasSpecialCharacters
  Description: This test checks if the `getAuthor` method correctly retrieves the author's name when it contains special characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the author's name to a string containing special characters.
  Act: Call the `getAuthor` method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned author's name matches the string with special characters that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly retrieves and returns strings with special characters. This test is significant to ensure that the method can handle and return strings with various character sets accurately.

Scenario 6: Validate the retrieval of the author when the author contains numeric characters.

Details:
  TestName: getAuthorWhenAuthorHasNumericCharacters
  Description: This test checks if the `getAuthor` method correctly retrieves the author's name when it contains numeric characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the author's name to a string containing numeric characters.
  Act: Call the `getAuthor` method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned author's name matches the string with numeric characters that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly retrieves and returns strings with numeric characters. This test is significant to ensure that the method can handle and return strings that include numbers accurately.

Scenario 7: Validate the retrieval of the author when the author is set to a very long string.

Details:
  TestName: getAuthorWhenAuthorIsVeryLongString
  Description: This test checks if the `getAuthor` method correctly retrieves the author's name when it is set to a very long string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the author's name to a very long string.
  Act: Call the `getAuthor` method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned author's name matches the very long string that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method can handle and return very long strings correctly. This test is significant to ensure that the method performs well and accurately with unusually long input values.
