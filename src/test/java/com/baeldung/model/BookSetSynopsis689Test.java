Scenario 1: Test for Valid Synopsis Input

Details:
  TestName: testSetSynopsisWithValidInput
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method setSynopsis correctly sets the synopsis when a valid input is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the object, ensuring no value is assigned to synopsis initially.
  Act: Invoke the setSynopsis method with a valid string parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the synopsis has been correctly set.
Validation:
  The assertion test aims to verify that when given a valid input, setSynopsis successfully assigns the provided synopsis. This scenario is significant as it confirms that the method behaves as expected under normal conditions.

Scenario 2: Test for Null Synopsis Input

Details:
  TestName: testSetSynopsisWithNullInput
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method setSynopsis handles null input properly without throwing an exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the object.
  Act: Invoke the setSynopsis method with null as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the synopsis is set to null without any errors.
Validation:
  The assertion test is to verify that when given null input, setSynopsis assigns null to synopsis without throwing any exceptions. This scenario checks if the method can handle edge cases.

Scenario 3: Test for Empty String Synopsis Input

Details:
  TestName: testSetSynopsisWithEmptyString
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method setSynopsis correctly handles an empty string as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the object.
  Act: Invoke the setSynopsis method with an empty string.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the synopsis is set to an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion test aims to verify that when given an empty string as input, setSynopsis assigns an empty string to synopsis. This scenario checks the method's handling of edge cases and its capability to work with different types of valid inputs.

Scenario 4: Test for Long String Synopsis Input

Details:
  TestName: testSetSynopsisWithLongString
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method setSynopsis can handle a very long string as synopsis without breaking.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the object.
  Act: Invoke the setSynopsis method with a very long string.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the synopsis is set to the long string.
Validation:
  The assertion test aims to verify that when given a long string input, setSynopsis correctly sets the input without any errors. This test is important to understand the capacity limits of the method.
