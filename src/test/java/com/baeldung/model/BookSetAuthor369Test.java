Scenario 1: Setting a Valid Author Name

Details:
  TestName: setAuthorWithValidName
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly sets a valid author name. The method should accept a typical author name and set the corresponding class field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setAuthor method and prepare a valid author name string.
  Act: Call the setAuthor method with the valid author name.
  Assert: Verify that the author field of the class instance is set to the valid author name.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the method correctly assigns a valid author name to the class field. The significance of this test is to ensure that the core functionality of setting an author is working as expected.

Scenario 2: Setting an Empty Author Name

  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly handles setting a very long author name. The method should accept a long string and set it as the author name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setAuthor method and prepare a very long author name string.
  Act: Call the setAuthor method with the long author name.
  Assert: Verify that the author field of the class instance is set to the long author name.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the method can handle and set a very long author name without any issues. The significance of this test is to ensure that the method can handle edge cases involving long strings.

Scenario 5: Setting an Author Name with Special Characters

Details:
  TestName: setAuthorWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly handles setting an author name with special characters. The method should accept a string containing special characters and set it as the author name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setAuthor method and prepare an author name string with special characters.
  Act: Call the setAuthor method with the special characters string.
  Assert: Verify that the author field of the class instance is set to the string with special characters.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the method can handle and set an author name with special characters. The significance of this test is to ensure that the method can handle edge cases involving special characters.

Scenario 6: Setting an Author Name with Leading and Trailing Spaces

Details:
  TestName: setAuthorWithLeadingTrailingSpaces
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly handles setting an author name with leading and trailing spaces. The method should accept a string with spaces at the beginning and end and set it as the author name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setAuthor method and prepare an author name string with leading and trailing spaces.
  Act: Call the setAuthor method with the string with spaces.
  Assert: Verify that the author field of the class instance is set to the string with leading and trailing spaces.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the method can handle and set an author name with leading and trailing spaces. The significance of this test is to ensure that the method can handle edge cases involving whitespace.

Scenario 7: Setting an Author Name with Non-ASCII Characters

Details:
  TestName: setAuthorWithNonASCIICharacters
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly handles setting an author name with non-ASCII characters. The method should accept a string containing non-ASCII characters (e.g., accented letters) and set it as the author name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setAuthor method and prepare an author name string with non-ASCII characters.
  Act: Call the setAuthor method with the non-ASCII characters string.
  Assert: Verify that the author field of the class instance is set to the string with non-ASCII characters.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the method can handle and set an author name with non-ASCII characters. The significance of this test is to ensure that the method can handle edge cases involving internationalization.

Scenario 8: Setting an Author Name with Only Whitespace

Details:
  TestName: setAuthorWithOnlyWhitespace
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly handles setting an author name that consists only of whitespace characters. The method should accept a string of whitespace and set it as the author name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setAuthor method and prepare a string consisting only of whitespace characters.
  Act: Call the setAuthor method with the whitespace string.
  Assert: Verify that the author field of the class instance is set to the whitespace string.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the method can handle and set an author name consisting only of whitespace. The significance of this test is to ensure that the method can handle edge cases involving different types of whitespace inputs.
