Scenario 1: Test for Valid True Input
  Details:
    TestName: shouldSetPurchasedToTrue
    Description: This test checks if the setPurchased method correctly sets the purchased value to true when true is passed as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: None required, as the method does not depend on any data or external factors.
    Act: Invoke the setPurchased method and pass in true as a parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the purchased value has been set to true.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that the setPurchased method correctly sets the purchased value when it is invoked with true. It is important for ensuring that the purchased status is correctly updated when a purchase is made.

Scenario 2: Test for Valid False Input
  Details:
    TestName: shouldSetPurchasedToFalse
    Description: This test checks if the setPurchased method correctly sets the purchased value to false when false is passed as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: None required, as the method doesn't depend on any data or external factors.
    Act: Invoke the setPurchased method and pass in false as a parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the purchased value has been set to false.
  Validation:
    This test aims to confirm that the setPurchased method correctly sets the purchased value when it is invoked with false. This is necessary for ensuring that the purchased status is correctly updated when a purchase is cancelled or not completed.

Scenario 3: Test for Null Input
  Details:
    TestName: shouldThrowExceptionForNullInput
    Description: This test checks if the setPurchased method throws an exception when null is passed as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: None required, as the method doesn't depend on any data or external factors.
    Act: Invoke the setPurchased method and pass in null as a parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect an exception to be thrown.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that the setPurchased method handles null input by throwing an exception. It is important for avoiding null pointer exceptions that could disrupt the execution of the program.
